Movie metadata:
	- Populated from the internet:
		- Photo or two
		- Genres
		- IMDB rating
		- Description?
		- Link to trailer?
	- My own tags (unseen)
	- My own rating
	
	
Desired functionality:
	- Display movies in a dense fashion
	- Filter based on tags/ratings
	- Search for a specific movie
	- Default config file to autoload directory
	
	
poster API: https://codepen.io/pixelnik/pen/pgWQBZ

Inputting movies:
	- drag and drop into folder
	- when program started, kick off new thread to do the following:
		- search movies and identify new ones
		- query DB and retrieve metadata
		- update movie as retrieved - tag on the file?
		- update the view so data propagates
	- if no match: popup presented to select one based on release dates/genres/desc
		
Flow:
	- Tiled movie posters, scaled to the same size. Probably makes sense for them to be buttons
	- Hover text shows genres/tags
	- Click triggers a popup with more images, full description, and a button to kickstart VLC


		
Additional config options:
	- default torrent directory
	- default shelf directory
	- max number of photos per movie
